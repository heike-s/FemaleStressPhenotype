Figure 3 demonstrates that female mice show behavioral variability distinct of that observed in males as a result of CSW/DS, and that this behavioral variability is driven by an attenuated behavioral regulation in response to target presence. This code generates Fig 3 and Fig. S2 as well as statistics for the results section **Dimensionality reduction identifies distinct sources of stress-related variance in males and females**.
